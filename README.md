# Noe-Arc
This is a code challenge assignment

# Problem Statement
Noe was able to travel to the future and discover programs could resolve many problems. He was talking with a programmer and ask him, if he could implement a program to identify the complete pairs of animals on his arc. Noe said that he has a identifier per each animal, which was the first 3 letters of the name, for example:
LIO for lions
ELE for elephants
SNA for snakes
FRO for frogs
GIR for giraffes
FOX for foxes
...
He was giving a 1 as label for the first animal of the pair that enters to the arc and 2 as label for the second one. The pairs were arriving separated to the arc, according to the current version of Noe. 
The input of your program is going to receive the record of the entrances with proper format via console.
The output of your program is to print in console the pairs that are complete in order of completion.
For example:
Input: 
ELE-1, ELE-2, SNA-1, FRO-1, FOX-1, LAM-1, FOX-2, GIR-1, GIR-2, FRO-2, LIO-1, LIO-2
Output:
ELE completed
FOX completed
GIR completed
FRO completed
LIO completed
Note: The input of the program could receive a partial record of the entrance, which means some pairs could be incompleted, in the previous example: SNA and LAM.
